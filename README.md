Your personal MapReduce for Steem - https://steem.io

## About

`steemreduce` does just one thing - it runs MapReduce over the given range of blocks,
thus allowing you to collect data and generate your own statistics. Cool, right?

There are certain MapReduce implementations already included in `steemreduce`.
Please check the respective README files in `mapreducers/<mapreduce_id>`.

## Usage

`steemreduce` is available for you already compiled on
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/tchap/steemreduce/tree/master). Just open the
most recent build, go to the Artifacts tab and choose the right binary for your
platform.

## More Handy MapReduce Implementations

In case there is a MapReduce you would like to have implemented, send me a
private message on Steem Slack, I am there as `@void`. I will write your
requested MapReduce and publish it at https://steemit.com as a standalone story
which you can upvote. Or you can send me some STEEM directly if you so decide.

## Issues
